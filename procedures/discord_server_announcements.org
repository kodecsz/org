#+title: Discord Server Announcements

This is a procedure of how to make announcements inside the Discord server.

* Classification
Before making a new announcement, we must classify the importance of the content.

This classification will be used to determine which role will be mentioned.

| Importance | Mention Role | Example                                                       |
|------------+--------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
| High       | @everyone    | Important update that affects everyone or big changes         |
| Medium     | @here        | Update that doesn't affect everyone, but it's still important |
| Low        | @news        | Not important updates, curiosities, and more                  |
